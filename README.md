Setup of a **media center** ([OSMC](https://osmc.tv/)) with **automated downloads** ([Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) + [Flex](http://flexget.com/)) in the background for new TV Shows, films or whatever you want. It's able to configure tasks to automate anything! 

All the magic possible thanks to **OSMC (media center)+ Transmission (torrent downloads) + Flex (automated taks)**


The main idea is to avoid any manual intervention to watch  your preferred shows, just sit and watch TV.


## Requirements
- A running OSMC ([Download](https://osmc.tv/download/) here).
- Hardware: A Raspberry Pi (1 or 2), Vero or Apple TV
- An account in [ShowRSS](https://showrss.info/) or similar RSS service that configures your own feed.
 
 
Tested on OSMC [**release 2015.08-1**](https://osmc.tv/download/images/)


## What you get:
- A mediacenter that works with your TV remote
- Your preferred TV Shows as soon as they are available
- All files when downloaded in their right folder structure
- Automatic subtitles in your language if you need them

Apart from the OSMC, you have the following remote services:

Service  | URL  | User / Password
-------- | ---- | -----------
Transmission GUI | http://$OSMC_HOST:9091 | transmission / transmission
Kodi Remote | http://$OSMC_HOST/ | None
Open SSH | ssh $OSMC_HOST |  osmc/osmc (`sudo` is available)

**Samba** is not installed. Is not necessary at all since the machine downloads everything. Punctual transfers can be done with `scp`. Raspberry has low RAM and the less services the better (Kodi already consumes a lot of RAM)

## Assumptions

When referring to `OSMC_HOST` this is the IP of your Rasperry. e.g:

	OSMC_HOST=192.168.1.135
	
# Setup

From your local machine:

  	
    OSMC_HOST=192.168.1.135
    # Copy SSH key to OSMC server
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh osmc@$OSMC_HOST 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh; umask 077; cat >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
    
Now SSH to the server:

    ssh osmc@$OSMC_HOST

# Prepare your folder structure
Omit this section if you want to keep all your data in `/home/osmc` with the current mounted disk.

I store all the data in a memory stick. As long as the USB media keeps the same name you can use as many as you want. I don't even change `fstab`.

Example folder is `/media/KINGSTON` which is the default auto mount location of the 64GB Kingston stick I use (18â‚¬).

	
	STORAGE_FOLDER=/media/KINGSTON

	mkdir -p $STORAGE_FOLDER/{Downloads/Incomplete,Movies,Music,Pictures,"TV Shows"}

	# Delete default folders in home and put symlinks to the USB.
	sudo rm -fri $STORAGE_FOLDER/{Downloads,Movies,Music,Pictures,"TV Shows"}
	ln -s $STORAGE_FOLDER/{Downloads,Movies,Music,Pictures,"TV Shows"} ~/

The home directory `/home/omsc` looks like this:

	lrwxrwxrwx 1 osmc osmc 25 Sep  4 18:54 Downloads -> /media/KINGSTON/Downloads
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 osmc osmc 22 Sep  4 18:54 Movies -> /media/KINGSTON/Movies
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 osmc osmc 21 Sep  4 18:54 Music -> /media/KINGSTON/Music
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 osmc osmc 24 Sep  4 18:54 Pictures -> /media/KINGSTON/Pictures
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 osmc osmc 24 Sep  4 18:54 TV Shows -> /media/KINGSTON/TV Shows
	
- Downloads is for manually added torrents to Transmission
- TV Shows is where all episodes are downloaded to with the structure `TV Shows/Show name/Season 1/Episode Name`

# Miscellaneous things

#### Broken locales
If you see this message on every login:

	-bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)`
   
Possible fix:

    sudo locale-gen "en_US.UTF-8"
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
    # Choose en_US.UTF-8

#### Force color prompt

Edit your `.bashrc` and uncomment, or for the lazy:

	sed -i 's/#force_color_prompt=yes/force_color_prompt=yes/' ~/.bashrc

#### Default editor
Set vi/nano/other default editor

	echo "export EDITOR=vi" >> ~/.bash_aliases	
	
# Not needed
	sudo apt-get install sqlite3

	sqlite> select * from seen_entry;
	sqlite> delete from seen_entry;
